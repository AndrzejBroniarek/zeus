The Zeus election server
========================

LICENCE: This code is released under the GPL v3 or later

This is a fork of Ben Adida's Helios server. The differences from Helios are as follows:

* Whereas Helios produces election results, Zeus produces a tally of the ballots casts.

* This allows Zeus to be used in voting systems other than approval voting (which is supported
  by Helios), since the vote tally can be fed to any other system that actually produces the 
  election results.

* In terms of overall architecture and implementation it is closer to the original Helios
  implementation than Helios v. 3
