\subsection*{Abstract}

We present Zeus, an Internet ballot casting and counting system
based on Helios that allows elections in which ballots cannot be
tallied homomorphically. Zeus separates the production of election
results from voting and counting, thus allowing any type of
elections to be carried out, while maintaining the main features of
the original Helios system in terms of anonymity and verifiability.

\section{Introduction}

Helios is a well known system for Internet voting, in which the whole
process is carried out through digital means---there is no paper
trace, nor ballots in physical forms. It has been used in several real
world elections and its basic architectural design has proven robust.

In this paper we present Zeus, a system based on Helios, which extends
Helios's range of applications while reducing the actual work
performed by Helios and its role in the election process. Helios is a
system that performs \emph{ballot casting}, \emph{ballot counting},
and \emph{production of election results}. Zeus performs only the
first two, leaving the production of election results to other
systems, or to additional modules. In this way, it can accommodate
more voting systems than Helios, which currently supports only
approval-like voting.

\section{Roots and Rationale}

Zeus was initiated after the use of electronic vote was permitted by
decree for the election of the Governing Councils of Higher Education
Institutions in Greece. In each institution the Governing Council is
directly elected by its faculty and is its main governing body. The
election uses the Single Transferable Vote (STV) system, in which
voters do not simply indicate the candidates of their preference, but
also rank them in order of preference. 

When we were charged with providing an implementation of a system
implementing electronic voting we decided to investigate Helios's
suitability, as we needed a mature system with a proven record in real
world elections and published open source code. The current version of
Helios (version 3) allows internet election from end-to-end: from the
moment the voter casts a ballot through a web browser to the
publication of election results. It does that by never actually
decrypting the ballots but performing a series of homomorphic
calculations on them. In the end, the results of the calculations are
decrypted and published. 

Although using a single system for the whole process is appealing, the
use of homomorphic counting in Helios cannot accommodate voting
systems in which not just the individual choices on the ballot matter,
but the whole ballot itself. In STV, homorphical tallying could pass
to the STV algorithm the information that a certain candidate has been
selected in rank $r$ by $n$ voters, but this is not enough, as the whole
ballot and not just each rank separately is passed around during STV's
counting rounds.

We realised, however, that it is not necessary to use Helios's
homomorphic counting capabilities. We decided to use Helios for
\emph{counting the ballots}, not for producing the election results.
Once we do have a veriable ballots count, this can be fed to an STV
calculator, or indeed to a calculator of any voting system. Since the
ballots are published, and the algorithm is also published, a third
party can always verify that the results are correct.

Interestingly, the original publication of Helios~\cite{adida:2008}
did not use homomorphic tallying, but relied on mixnets for
guaranteeing voter anonymity. ~\cite{bulens:2011}

\section{Ballot Casting and Encoding}

In Helios, ballots consist of answers to binary ``yes'' or ``no''
questions, framed in the appropriate way. For instance, a voter
indicates $k$ out of $n$ candidates on a ballot by selecting them, in
which case the answer ``Would you like X as a Y?'' gets a yes (1),
otherwise a no (0). In STV, as in any system in which we would need
the whole ballot to be decrypted in the end, the ballot must be
encoded in some way. We encode each ballot as a integer by assigning a
unique number to each possible candidate selection and ranking. The
total number of possible ballots is $p _{n1} + p_{n2} + \cdots + p
_{nk}$, where $p_{nk}$ is the number of sequences of $k$ objects out
of $n$, that is $p_{nk} = n(n - 1)\cdots(n - k + 1)$\footnote{The
  number $p_{nk}$ is also written $n^{\underline{k}}$, or $(n)_k$,
  called ``Pochhammer's symbol''~\cite[p.\ 48]{graham:1994}. In closed
  form it is $p_{nk} = \sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^{n-k}\left\{n \atop
    k\right\}x^k$, where $\left\{n \atop k\right\}$ is the Stirling
  number of the first kind~\cite{weisstein:pochhammer}.}. As each
ballot is sent in encrypted form to the Zeus server, for its encoding
number $b$ we must have $b \in [0, 10^p]$, where $p$ is the order of
the group used in the ElGamal encryption scheme, so the encoding does
not present a practical limit in real elections (if it did, we could
always break the number in parts and send them separately).

The implementation of the encoding follows closely the mathematical
definition. We encode each ballot as an integer by enumerating the set
$\mathcal{E}$ of all possible ballots. We take $k$ choices out of $n$,
for $0\leq k \leq C$, where $C$ is the maximum choices allowed in the
ballots \footnote{$N=C$ for the elections we hosted}, and we then take
their $k!$ permutations. Summing it up, all the possible ballots are
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:max_encoded}
|\mathcal{E}| = \sum^{s}_{k=0}\binom{n}{k}k! \quad
\hbox{\small where} \quad 0\leq k \leq C
\end{equation}
When enumerating, we first count the smaller selections (i.e. take
\textit{zero} candidates, then \textit{one}, then \textit{two},
\ldots) so that for small numbers of choices the encoded ballot will
have a small value, thus saving valuable bit-space. \footnote{ For
  example, selecting up to all of 300 candidates needs 2048 bits,
  while selecting 10 out of 1000 candidates needs only 100 bits.}

% ballots. 

\section{The Cryptographic Model}

We have collected all cryptographic aspects of Zeus elections and
implemented them into a generic, standalone, and extensible software
module. \footnote{\texttt{zeus.core}} This module implements an
abstract version of the election workflow, all the required
cryptographic functions, and all validations of data and the workflow
itself. This module is fitted into the production environment by
software extensions (i.e. subclassing) where the web application uses
it as needed.

\subsection{Software Dependencies}
Random number generation \emph{(Fortuna)}, primality testing
\emph{(Miller-Rabin)} and modulo inversion from \texttt{PyCrypto}.
Exponentiation from \texttt{libgmp} via \texttt{gmpy} (really faster
than Python's builtin \texttt{pow}). We have implemented all other
operations in native Python and the Python standard library, including
hashing. We have studied \texttt{Helios}, \texttt{PloneVoteCryptoLib},
\texttt{PyCrypto} for our implementation.

% \subsection{Cryptosystem}
% Zeus uses the ElGamal cryptosystem on the prime-order-$q$ subgroup
% $\mathcal{G}$ of the quadratic residues of a safe prime $p = 2q + 1$,
% such that
% $$m \in \mathcal{G} \longleftrightarrow \mathcal{L}(m) = m^q = 1 \mod p$$
% $\mathcal{L}$ being the \emph{Legendre} symbol.
% For reference, we reproduce all the primitives we use in a table.
% All base numbers are in $\mathcal{G}$, all exponents in $\mathbb{Z}^{*}_q$,
% and all operations are $\mod p$, unless explicitly noted.
% We group $x=a, y=b, \ldots$ as $(x,y,\ldots)\equiv(a,b,\ldots)$.

\section{Election User Interface}

The users of Zeus were not expected to be experts in cryptography, or
to have any knowledge of computer science; we could only assume
familiarity with internet browsing, since the electoral body comprises
people with heterogeneous characteristics. A significant design goal
was therefore \emph{interface}, and \emph{workflow} simplicity. At the
same time, the knowledgeable voter needed access to all information
and functions needed to both understand and verify the process.

\subsection{Zeus Users}

Zeus distinguishes the following classes of users:

\begin{itemize}
\item Election administrators
\item Election committee members
\item Voters
\end{itemize}

Election administrators are responsible for setting up an election;
that is, starting a new election instance in Zeus, setting the date
for the election, entering the particulars of the election committee
members and the list of voters. During the election the administrators
are responsible for updaging the list of voters (i.e., adding,
removing, or updating the details for a voter) and extending the poll
times, if necessary. When polls close the administrators are
responsible for starting the ballot mixing and vote count process.
Election committee members hold the cryptographic keys for the
election. Before the election starts they have to create their keys
and upload the public parts to the Zeus server. During decryption each
election committee member partially decrypts the ballots using the
private part of the key. Voters visit the voting booth to cast their
vote; they can vote repeatedly until polls close.

Election administrators access Zeus through a username and password.
Election committee members and voters access Zeus through URL links
that are sent to them by the system, as we see below.

\section{The Election Workflow in Zeus}

The election workflow in Zeus consists of the following phases:
election preparation, polling, and tallying.

\subsection{Preparing the Election}

\subsubsection{Initialisation}

The election administrator initialises the election in Zeus by
entering the polling date (or dates), the members of the election
committee, the name of the election and any other information required
for defining the process. The election administrator may be a member
of the election committee.

\subsubsection{Notifications to the Election Committee}

The election administrator uses Zeus to send notifications to the
election committee members. The notifications contain URLs by which
the committee members can access the system in order to generate and
upload their encryption keys.

\subsubsection{Generation of Election Keys}

Committee members generate their encryption keys. The encryption keys
are generated in their browsers and the members are instructed to save
them in a secure place. They then upload the public parts of their
keys to Zeus, to be used for encryption the voters' ballots when polls
open. 

\subsubsection{Ballot Setup}

The election administrator in coordination with the election committee
sets up the election ballots. This includes defining the number of
ballot questions and acceptable answers, whether the order of ballot
choices will be important (as in STV) or not (as in approval voting),
and the contents of each ballot.

\subsubsection{Voters Addition}

Voters are entered to the system by the administrator and the election
committee by means of a CSV file (typically generated through a
spreadsheet application) containing, for each voter the voter's email
and name.

\subsubsection{Election Freeze}

Finally the election is frozen; when this happens, the voters receive
at their mailboxes a message inviting them to cast their vote. The
message contains a link that leads them to the voting booth, where
they can compile their ballot. The voting booth opens at the date and
time appointed by the election authority; if the voters visit the link
before, they are informed accordingly.

\subsection{Voting}

Voters access the voting booth via the link they have received. They
compose their ballot, which they proceed to submit. All the process
happens at the client browser, with no interaction with the server
until the ballot has been encrypted and sent to be stored along with
the rest of the election's ballots.

\subsection{Tallying}

% \section{Implementation Considerations}

\section{Experience}

From the voter's point of view, there has been a published usability
analysis of Helios~\cite{karayumak:2011}. 

Zeus was used in 23 elections that took place in 22 institutions
around Greece (see Table~\ref{table:zeus-elections}).
