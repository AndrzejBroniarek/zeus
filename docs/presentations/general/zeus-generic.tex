\section{Paper Ballots}

\subsection{Advantages}

\begin{frame}{Why Paper Ballots?}{A lot going for them.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Long experience (how long have we been using them?)
  \item Low tech solution (for those running the election)
  \item No skills required (at most reading and writing, and then
    again not always)
  \item There is an underlying physical asset \pause the ballot itself
  \item People may actually enjoy election day
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What If\ldots}{Something Goes Wrong?}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1->Can I prove that I have voted?
    \pause Yes
  \item<2->Is my vote anonymous?
    \pause Yes
  \item<3->Have all votes been counted?
    \pause Yes
  \item<4->Has my vote been counted?
    \pause Yes
  \item<5->It is possible to add votes?
    \pause No
  \item<5->It is possible to falsify votes?
    \pause No
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Underlying Assumptions}{That We Usually Take for Granted}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item<1->The election authorities are trustworthy and independent
  \item<2->Favourable political climate
  \item<3->Logistics have been solved \pause or we may need to call in
    international monitors etc.
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Disadvantages}

\begin{frame}{Why Then Consider e-Voting?}{Issues with Paper Ballots}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Logistics are cumbersome
  \item Cost
  \item Not everybody is able to go to the ballot box
  \item Counting can take a long time and is boring
  \item The underlying physical asset (the ballot) is vulnerable to
    physical destruction (fire, water, theft,\ldots)
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\section{Requirements for an e-Voting System}

\begin{frame}{Democratic}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Only eligible voters can vote.
  \item Each eligible voter can cast at most one vote (that counts).
  \end{itemize}

\vfill

Source of e-Voting System Requirements:
\url{http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.897/spring04/L17.pdf}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Private}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item No one can tell how a voter actually voted (anonymity, at
    least within large enough cohort/precinct of voters).
  \item OK (perhaps even mandatory) to publish who voted (though,
    obviously not actual ballot content).
  \end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Uncoercible}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Voter cannot be coerced or bribed to vote a particular way.
  \item Voter cannot prove how they voted to another party:
    receipt-free. (Note how this requirement assumes the voter may be
    an adversary.)
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Accurate}

  The final tally is the correct sum of cast votes.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Cast ballots can't be altered, deleted, substituted.
    \item All cast ballots are counted; other (invalid) ballots can't
      be added.
    \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Verifiable}

  \begin{quote}
  I consider it completely unimportant who in the party
  will vote, or how; but what is extraordinarily important is
  this---who will count the votes, and how. 
  \end{quote}
  Joseph Stalin 

  In Russian: Я считаю, что совершенно неважно, кто и как будет в
  партии голосовать; но вот что чрезвычайно важно, это---кто и как
  будет считать голоса. 

  Said in 1923, as quoted in The Memoirs of Stalin's Former Secretary
  (1992) by Boris Bazhanov [Saint Petersburg] (Борис Бажанов.
  Воспоминания бывшего секретаря Сталина). 

  Variant (loose) translation: The people who cast the votes decide
  nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Verifiable}

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual verifiability: each voter may verify their vote.
\item Representative verifiability: each voter may delegate to a party
  or other representative the task of verifying the vote (without
  revealing the vote in the clear, of course).
\item Universal verifiability: anyone can verify total.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Robust}

\begin{itemize}
\item A small group can't disrupt election (DOS attacks, complaint
  procedures, etc\ldots)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Fairness}

\begin{itemize}
  \item No partial results are known before the election is closed.
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Ease of Use}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Good user interface
  \item Accessibility and usability guidelines
  \item Accessibility from a wide variety of input devices
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[Efficiency]

\begin{itemize}
  \item Efficient ballot casting
  \item Efficient ballot counting
  \end{itemize}
  
\end{frame}

\section{The Helios Voting System and Process}

\begin{frame}{Basic Ideas}

\begin{itemize}
\item Ballots are encrypted on the browser before being sent to the
  server.
\item Ballots are stored in the server in encrypted form.
\item The decryption keys are kept by the Election Committee.
\item Encrypted ballots are randomly mixed in order to break the
  association between ballots and voters.
\item The encrypted mixed ballots are decrypted by the Election
  Commitee.
\item The process can be verified mathematically.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Basic Assumptions}

\begin{itemize}
\item You do not need to trust the administrators of Helios.
\item You do not need to trust each member of the Election Committee.
\item You need to trust that at least one member of the Election
  Committee is honest.
\item Coercion is avoided by allowing multiple ballots per user (only
  the last one counts).
\end{itemize}
